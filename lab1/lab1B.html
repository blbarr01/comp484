                        this album highly enough. The song to listen to is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5xRq5f1kCU"> Loose Sutures</a> wasting no time with a solid intro riff,
                        killer guitar leads, and a call and response section between the drums and bass.
                        If you're not hooked by six seconds, you should get your money back.

                        This is an album to best listen to like a Pink Floyd album: start at track one, click play and just go.
